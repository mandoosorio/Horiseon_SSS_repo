In this project we developed a concise piece of html while adding "alt" attributes to benefit those using a website reader. We gave the website a title that appears on the tab and we cleaned up css, removing various css lines by assigning class and ids to group css. Also made sure that all clickable titles jumped to the correct part of the page.
